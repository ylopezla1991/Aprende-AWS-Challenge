# Aprende-DevOps-Challenge
DevOps is a combination of philosophies, practices, and tools that increases our ability to deliver applications and services.

As a DevOps at Aprende, you are requested to design a diagram of a n-tier architecture on AWS to host and provide to our students and teachers a reliable LMS platform.

The diagram should address network fundamentals, AWS services involved, connectivity between services and key nodes. Also include a clear description for each technology layer and the reason for your architectural choices.

The architecture should be able to scale up/down based on demand in order to respond to higher and lower user requests. There are hours in a day where the platform is more crowded than others.

 

# Acceptance criteria

Deliver the requested diagram and a clear description of each of your choices included.

All the application data is stored in a MySQL database.

The architecture should support a 0 downtime process to scale up / down.

Make sure the Diagram and description are pushed and accessible on GitHub.
